Like any genre, there is a special time and place for different types of music. For example, in fashion, you may have branded your own personal style, but still dip into different styles and trends as well. Country music is widely popular in North America, particularily in the United States. Not only was it derrived obviously from Western culture, country music often revolves around the theme of patriotism and the all-American lifestyle. The overall tone surrounds one's desire for love/romantisicm, summer, friends, celebration, beer, and much more. For this reason, it is incredibly happy, soulful and relaxing. In fact, many contry songs are balads or love songs, with musical production typically involving string instruments such as acoustic guitar or banjos.
