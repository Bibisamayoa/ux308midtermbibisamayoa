Electronic, or EDM (electronic dance music) is a newer genre, made mostly of synthesized sounds from existing instruments. Originally, it was invented by artists who essentially reproduced or remixed existing songs, instead of creating new songs entirely. DJ's and music producers began manipulating current songs, layering different beats or melodies over top, and eventually, it evolved into it's own genre. As it states in the name, EDM was made for dancing, which is why it is growing increasingly popular. Not only is it danceable, it is generally the music of choice at  nightclubs and social outings. Many electronic songs lack lyrics, and are extremely production-heavy. Without this major component, I believe it is rather impressive to capture such a vast audience without the use of a direct message. The goal is simply to have people on their feet, dancing and enjoying the sound of various digital instruments. This genre of music was made to be performed, and the experience of hearing it played live is like no other. Because as mentioned- even without words- everyone in the room is able to connect over a common love for music.
