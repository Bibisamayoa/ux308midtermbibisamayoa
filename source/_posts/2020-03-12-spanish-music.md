As of lately, Spanish music has made an entrance in the realm of popular music. More and more, we are seeing mainstream artists team up and collborate with a latinx artist. Some include, J Balvin, Bad Bunny, Cardi B, Selena Gomez and Drake. In Latin culture, upbeat dance music is an integral ingredient for any fiesta or social gathering- undeniably what it was made for. Spain's rich history of folk and flamenco, is seen through this type of music. I believe what makes Spanish music in particular, so poplar around the globe, is the fact that it is so danceable. Without neccessarily understanding the context of a song, one simply cannot sit still at the sound of a snare drum and impeccable rythm.
