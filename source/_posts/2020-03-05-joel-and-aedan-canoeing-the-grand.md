Hip-hop, rap and R&B (rhythm and blues) are three genres of music that are closely related. The term "hip-hop" is derived from the trend culture this music often falls into. According to Spotify, hip-hop is the most popular genre of music globally. Why does this genre of music resonate so deeply, with so many people? By nature, rap music is brutally honest and truthful. Dating back to the 1970's, it started as a medium for young artists to express any kind of emotion, the good, the bad, and the ugly. I believe passion and truth is something that will always connect with people, the extent to which listeners are able to relate to the artist they are listening to, is indicative of the success of that song/artist's success. Remember, music is both a means of self expression for some, and an escape for others. Apart from it's powerful lyricism, hip-hop and rap music are typically rather bass-heavy which many find to be infectiously rhythmic.
